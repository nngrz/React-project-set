### Tenzies Game App

Tenzies is a fun and simple dice game where the goal is to roll ten dice that all show the same number. Players can click on individual dice to "hold" them, and held dice will turn light green. When rolling the dice, the held dice won't change.

The game continues as players strategically hold and roll dice. Once all ten dice show the same number, a confetti animation will celebrate the win, and the "Roll" button will change to "Reset Game." Clicking "Reset Game" starts a new round from the beginning.
