What does notes app do: I implemented a notes app using code from the Scrimba team, adding functionality to create, delete, and update notes. I also ensured that the most recently modified note moves to the top of the list. Finally, I integrated Firebase Firestore to store the notes in the cloud, providing real-time syncing and scalability. Firebase was chosen to enhance the app's persistence and reliability.
