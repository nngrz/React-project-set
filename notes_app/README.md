### Notes App

The Notes App allows users to create, delete, and update notes, with the most recently modified note automatically moving to the top of the list. It uses Firebase Firestore to store the notes in the cloud, enabling real-time syncing across devices. This ensures that users can access and modify their notes instantly, with changes reflected in real-time.
